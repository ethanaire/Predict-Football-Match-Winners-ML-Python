# Predicting Football Match Winners ML with Python

## Overview

In this project, we'll predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).  

**Project Steps:**

* Investigating Missing Data
* Cleaning Data for ML Algorithm
* Creating Predictors for ML Algorithm
* Training the initial ML Model 
* Improving the Model precision with Rolling Averages 
* Retraining the Model 
* Combining Home and Away Predictions 

## File

* `scraping.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that scrapes our data.
* `prediction.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that makes predictions. 

## Data

We'll be scraping [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) to get our data in the first part of this project (`scraping.ipynb`).
